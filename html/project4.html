                <h2>Laufey</h2>

                <p>Laufey Lín Bing Jónsdóttir (Chinese: 林冰; pinyin: Lín Bīng; born 23 April 1999), known as Laufey (/ˈleɪveɪ/ LAY-vay), is an Icelandic singer and musician. She achieved prominence in the early 2020s for her success as a jazz-inspired pop artist.

                    Having performed as a cello soloist with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra at age 15, Laufey was a finalist in the 2014 edition of Ísland Got Talent [is] (Iceland's Got Talent), and a semi-finalist on The Voice Iceland the following year. She released her debut EP, Typical of Me (2021), and graduated from the Berklee College of Music in Boston. Her debut album, Everything I Know About Love (2022), charted in Iceland and the United States. Its follow-up, Bewitched (2023), won Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards (2024) and its single "From the Start" found moderate chart success in Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. </p>
